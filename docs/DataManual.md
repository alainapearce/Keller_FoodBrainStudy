# Introduction

## Overview of Study

  Reducing intake from large food portions is of critical importance to preventing obesity. People consistently eat more when they are served larger portions, a phenomenon known as the portion size effect. The mechanisms of the portion size effect are not well understood, and investigating the underlying neurobiology that drives this phenomenon may inform the development of more effective obesity prevention programs. The proposed research will follow healthy weight children who vary by family risk for obesity to identify the neurobiological and appetitive traits that are implicated in overeating and weight gain during the critical pre-adolescent period. Our central hypothesis is that increased intake from large portions of energy dense foods is due in part to reduced activity in brain regions implicated in inhibitory control and decision making, combined with increased activity in reward processing pathways. 
  
  To test this hypothesis, we will recruit 7-8 year-old healthy weight children at two levels of obesity risk based on parent weight status (i.e., high-risk and low-risk).  
  * Aim 1: We will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize neural response to food portion size and energy denisty in children with high- and low-risk for obesity. 
  * Aim 2: We will determine the relationship between neural response to visual portion size cues and measured food intake when portions are increased in the laboratory. 
  * Aim 3: We will determine the relationship between neural response to large portions and other validated measures of overeating such as  satiety responsiveness and eating in the absence of hunger. 
  * Aim 4: We will conduct follow-up visits one year after baseline to determine the extent to which baseline brain and behavioral responses to portion size predict gains in adiposity. 
  
 ## Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

In order to be enrolled, children must be of good health based on parental self-report, have no learning disabilities or developmental delays (e.g., ADHD, Autism, dyslexia), speak English fluently, not be on any medications known to influence body weight, taste, food intake, behavior, or blood flow, not be claustrophobic, and between the ages of 7-8 years-old at enrollment The biological mother and biological father must have a body mass index either between 18.5 - 25 kg/m2 (low-risk group) or greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 for mothers and  greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 for fathers  (high-risk group) and must be available to attend the visits with their child.

Children would be excluded if they are not within the age requirements (< than 7 years old or > than 8 years-old at baseline). Children will be excluded if they are taking cold or allergy medication, or other medications known to influence cognitive function, taste, appetite, or blood flow. Children will be excluded if they are red/green colorblind or if they do not speak English fluently. Children will be excluded if they report being claustrophobic, or if they have any of the following: a learning disability, ADD/ADHD, language delays, autism, dyslexia, a pre-existing medical condition such as type I or type II diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Cushing’s syndrome, Down’s syndrome, food allergies, severe lactose intolerance, Prader-Willi syndrome, HIV, cancer, renal failure, or cerebral palsy. Children will be excluded if they have tattoos, permanent makeup, dental ware, pacemakers, or metal implants that would preclude safe completion of the MRI. Furthermore, children will be excluded if they have receivedan X-ray in the previous month (to avoid excess radiation exposure due to the DXA scans performed in the research). Families will be excluded if the biological mother/father has a body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2 or between 25-29.9 kg/m2 for mothers. Children will be excluded if their BMI is not below the 90th percentile at the first visit.  Families will also be excluded if the primary parent in charge of making feeding decisions is unable to attend the study visits, or if the family reports plans to move away from the area in the next year

* Note: due to COVID enrollement challenges, inclusion criteria have been widened to allow inclusion of children whose biological mother has body mass index between 18.5 - 25 kg/m2 (low-risk group) or greater than 30 kg/m2 (high-risk group), regardless of biological father's body mass index

### Outcomes of Interest

Performace on the GNG task is typicall assessed based on correct responses and errors. Correct responses are often called ‘Hits’. There are two primary errors that can occur in the GNG task. Omission errors are when the participant failed to respond to a target/go stimuli while commission errors occur when the participant response to a NoGo trial. These types of errors are often called ‘misses’ and ‘false alarms’, respectively. In addition to response correctness, reaction time is also used to look at differences between correct responses and false alarms.

Signal Detection Theory (SDT) attempts to determine thresholds at which a person can distinguish a pattern (e.g., signal) from random patterns of noise. In the context of GNG, it is a technique to assess the ability to detect the NoGo signal during the task. Below are metrics that can be used to test signal detection and the accompanying equations. Non-parametric measures were included due to the fact because it is likely that the signal and noise distributions do not meet the following assumptions: 1) both are normal; and 2) have the same SD. It is not possible to test these assumptions with Yes/No tasks like GNG. When these assumptions are not met, sensory sensitivity will vary with differing response biases. See the following paper for an explanation of the selected measures and has excellent references for further reading: (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999).

* d’: d-prime is a parametric measure of sensory sensitivity—it is equal to the distance between the noise distribution and the signal and noise distribution

>> $d^{\prime} = \phi^{- H} - \phi^{-FA} → z(H)-z(FA)$  
H:percent hits; FA: percent false alarms; and z is derived from the normal inverse distribution

* A’: A-prime is a non-parametric measure of sensory sensitivity; generally between 0.5 - 1

>> $A^{\prime} = .5 + \frac{(H - FA)(1 + H - FA)}{4H(1 - FA)}$ when $H \ge FA$  
$A^{\prime} = .5 - \frac{(FA - H)(1 + FA - H)}{4H(1 - H)}$ when $FA \ge H$  
H: percent hits; FA: percent false alarms

* c: is a measure of bias—distance between the criterion and a neutral point where neither response is favored—the neutral point is where the signal and noise distributions overlap. Negative values correspond to bias to respond ‘yes’ (i.e., press for Go) and positive corresponds to bias to respond ‘No’

>> $c = \frac{\phi^-H + \phi^- FA)}{2} → \frac{z(H)+ z(FA)}{2}$  
 H:percent hits; FA: percent false alarms; and z is derived from the normal inverse distribution

* β’’ (Geir’s β): is a non-parametric measure of response bias—it is the ratio of the ordinate (i.e., height) of the signal and noise distribution at the criterion to the the ordinate of the noise distribution

>> $β^{\prime\prime} = \frac{H(1 - H) - FA(1 - FA)}{H(1 - H) + FA(1 - FA)}$ when $H \ge FA$  
$β^{\prime\prime} = \frac{FA(1 - FA) - H(1 - H)}{FA(1 - FA) + H(1 - H)}$ when $FA \ge H$  
H:percent hits;FA:percent false alarms

### Outcomes of Interest

Participants’ stop-signal reaction times (SSRT) was computed using the integration method after replacing omitted go responses with the participants’ slowest go RT (Verbruggen et al., 2019). SSRT was only computed if the assumptions of the racehorse model were met (i.e., go RT > unsuccessful stop RT; Verbruggen et al., 2019). Of the children with usable resting state data, 1 participant was excluded for not meeting the assumptions of the race model, and was therefore treated as missing data and imputed in subsequent analyses.

## Food Stop-Signal Task

The stop-signal task (SST) assesses inhibitory control by measuring the latency of response inhibition. The SST was adapted from the implementation in (Verbruggen, Logan, & Stevens, 2008). For a thorough discussion of the theoretical basis for the race-horse model of response inhibition see (Verbruggen & Logan, 2009). The basic premise is that participants will first activate a go-response to a stimuli. After seeing the stop stimuli, they will activate a nogo-response. If they are successful in inhibiting the go-response, the nogo-response was faster. If they fail to inhibit the go-response, the nogo-response was too slow. In this task, inhibition can be measured by manipulating the delay of the stop signal using a step-like function to hold successful stopping at a .5 probability.

![Racehorse_Model](./images/sst_racehorse_model.png)

### Task Design

The SST was administered using Matlab2018b and Psychtoolbox3. Plates of food were presented with a triangle-folded napkin on either the left or right side of the plate (go stimulus; see Figure 1) for 1500 ms with an inter-stimulus-interval of 50 ms (i.e., fixation). Children were asked to sort the plates according to which side of the plate the napkin was on and to press the left or right arrow keys when the napkin appeared on the left or right side of the plate, respectively. They were encouraged to respond as quickly as possible. They were also told that the plate would be sometimes get covered with a warmer dome (i.e., stop-signal; see Figure 1) and were instructed not to respond if the dome appeared.  The warmer dome (i.e., stop-signal) was presented after variable delay on 25% of trials. The variable stop-signal delay (SSD) was determined by a step-wise adaptive procedure which increased the SSD 50ms after each successful stop trial and reduced the SSD by 50 ms after each unsuccessful stop trial with the first SSD = 250 ms. This adaptive procedure maintained ~0.50 probability of successful response inhibition. The task parameters were based on specifications articulated by Verbruggen and colleagues (2019) for best practices in measuring stop-signal reaction time according to the theoretical racehorse model. 

The task consisted of 256 trials across 4 randomized blocks (i.e., 64 trials per block), two of which included foods with high-energy density (ED; i.e. a chocolate brownie) and two of which included foods with low-ED (i.e. blueberries). The portion size (e.g., large vs small) of presented foods varied across trials. Prior to the task, children completed 32 practice trials to ensure they understood the instructions. After the practice, children were reminded to respond quickly and told that they may be encourage to respond quickly during the task. To prevent children from slowing throughout the task, which is a known issue, the message ‘Faster’ was presented after trials in which they responded slower than 1.5 standard deviations below their mean reaction time in practice. Between each block, children were given the opportunity to take a break and were shown their average response time (e.g., ‘How Fast Were You?’), given encouragement for how quickly the were responding (e.g., ‘Wow, that is faster than a second’), and were reminded not to press the arrow keys if the dome covered the plate.

### Children's Body Image Scale (CBIS)

The Children's Body Image Scale asks children to identify which of seven body sillhouettes (according to child sex) matches their current body shape: "Out of these pictures, which looks most like your body?". Children are then asked to select which sillhouette they would like to have: "Out of these pictures, which body shape would you most like to have?"

Scale: The sillhouette with the least depicted adipose tissue is assigned the lowest value (1) and sillhouette with the most depicted adipose tissue is assinged the highest value (7)

Scoring: The difference between percieved and ideal body sillhoutte is computed

Outcome Measures:
